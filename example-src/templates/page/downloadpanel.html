    <p class="lead">Once your happy with the changes, click the <span class="text-primary">Download Buttons</span> below and you will get the Theme customisations (in JSON or CSS)</p>
    <p>The <strong>theme.css</strong> file will be a modified bootstrap.css file, so you can replace your bootstrap.css file (if you have one) with the theme.css file and your customised theme will be used.</p>
    <p>The <strong>theme.json</strong> file can be used to import the customisations back into Cluckles at a later point, so you dont have to start customising from scratch again!</p>

    <em>I also developed the <a href="https://github.com/ilikeprograms/BootstrapThemeBundle">BoostrapThemeBundle</a> for Symfony2, which integrates Bootstrap Themeing for Symfony apps (which embeds Cluckles).</em>
