  <h1>{{ site.title }}??</h1>
  <p>I made this tool because I needed a way to Live edit Bootstrap in <em><a href="https://github.com/ilikeprograms/corvus" title="Corvus on Github" target="_blank">Corvus</a></em>. I couldn't find anything existing which I could integrate into the project, so I made <em>Bootstrap Theme Editor</em>.</p>
  <p>If you find the project useful, feel free to fork it and extend it, or even donate to the project with <a href="https://www.gittip.com/ilikeprograms/" title="iLikePrograms on Gittip" target="_blank">Gittip</a> <img src="http://img.shields.io/gittip/ilikeprograms.svg" alt="ilikeprograms Gittip status" /></p>

      <h2>So what does {{ site.title }} do?</h2>

      <p>
        {{ site.title }} is a Live Theme Editor for CSS Framework based on Less such as Twitter Bootstrap, and currently allows Bootstrap Themes to be completely customised <sup>(In the future I will look into adding support other CSS Frameworks)</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I created {{ site.title }} I was looking for a way to Customise Bootstrap based Themes, and found online editors, all of which allows you to customise.
        However None of which provided access to the source files which provided the Ability to customise the Themes. So I created my own, which I could utilise in other projects,
        and released it so everyone else can too!

      <h2>But really ... {{ site.title }}</h2>

      <p>Yes. I like product names with some character. After a while I settled on Cluckles, because its not something someone would forget, plus I quite like chickens!</p>
