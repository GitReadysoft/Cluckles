  <h1>BootstrapThemeEditor</h1>
  <p>Bootstrap Theme Editor allows live modification of Bootstrap themes so that you can customise them easily. There is an example page provided (build/example/index.html) which makes it easy to see it in action!</p>

  <p>The example deme page has a User Interface which has panels where you can change the different parts of bootstrap by using color pickers to change the styling. Simple and Easy.</p>

  <p>The included files can be distributed and used in other projects to provide live editing functionality for Bootstrap.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>I made this tool because I needed a way to Live edit Bootstrap in <a href="https://github.com/ilikeprograms/corvus">Corvus</a>. I couldnt find anything existing which I could integrate into the project, so I made BootstrapThemeEditor.</p>
  <p>If you find the project usefull, feel free to fork it and extend it, or even dontate to the project with <a href="https://www.gittip.com/ilikeprograms/">Gittip</a> <img src="http://img.shields.io/gittip/ilikeprograms.svg" alt="ilikeprograms Gittip status" /></p>
